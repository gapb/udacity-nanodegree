This is an attempt at a minimal implementation of the project, done as simply as
possible while fulfilling the project requirements. To run it, unzip every file
into the same directory and then use python to execute entertainment_center.py.
The program will then generate a fresh_tomatoes.html file and open it in your
default web browser.

entertainment_center.py contains both the movie information (as string literals
within Movie objects), and a main() function guarded by the requisite
"if __name__ == "__main__":" statement.

media.py defines the Movie class to store movie information.

fresh-tomatoes.py is almost unchanged from the provided version, except for a
small bit of explanatory commentary on the top.

This program was developed and tested under Python 2.7.10 using PyCharm.
Add to repo.
